## 🧩 Code Logic Breakdown

1. **Main Loop (`while`):**  
   Keeps the ATM running until the user selects Exit (option 4).

2. **Switch Case:**
   - `1` → Display current balance  
   - `2` → Deposit funds  
   - `3` → Withdraw funds (with validation)  
   - `4` → Exit program  
   - *Default* → Handles invalid inputs  

3. **Validation Checks:**
   - Prevents withdrawing more than balance  
   - Disallows negative withdrawals  
   - Restricts withdrawal amount to ≤ 100 taka
